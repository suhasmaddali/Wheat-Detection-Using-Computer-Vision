# Wheat Detection Using Computer Vision 

We use wheat everyday in the form of bread, oats and other important breakfast and lunch items. It would be really good if the manual process of detecting wheat is replaced by machine learning and data science. Since there are many forms of wheat, we must be identifying the right kinds of wheat plants so that they could be processed quickly. This could be done with the convoluted neural networks and it becomes a computer vision problem.

In the machine learning project, we would be detecting various important parameters that are needed to detect the wheat types. There are different values of the bounding boxes present in both the training and the testing set respectively.
