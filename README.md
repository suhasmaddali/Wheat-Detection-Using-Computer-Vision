We use wheat everyday in the form of bread, oats and other important breakfast and lunch items. It would be really good if the manual process of detecting wheat is replaced by machine learning and data science. Since there are many forms of wheat, we must be identifying the right kinds of wheat plants so that they could be processed quickly. This could be done with the convoluted neural networks and it becomes a computer vision problem.

In the machine learning project, we would be detecting various important parameters that are needed to detect the wheat types. There are different values of the bounding boxes present in both the training and the testing set respectively.

## Directions to run the Ipython notebook 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Once the Git is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to add the files or the repository. 
3. You'll have to click on "Gitbash here" that would be opened when you right click on a particular location. 
4. One the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then copy the clipboard file that is present when you click on Code in Github. The link must be pasted and run so that the files would be downloaded at the location of interest. 
5. Later, you'll need to use Anaconda Prompt and add "Jupyter notebook" in the prompt. 
6. This would open the jupyter notebook that could be used to run and load the .ipynb files respectively. Therefore, you would be able to run the project at hand.
