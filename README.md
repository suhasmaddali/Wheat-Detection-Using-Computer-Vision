We use wheat everyday in the form of bread, oats and other important breakfast and lunch items. It would be really good if the manual process of detecting wheat is replaced by machine learning and data science. Since there are many forms of wheat, we must be identifying the right kinds of wheat plants so that they could be processed quickly. This could be done with the convoluted neural networks and it becomes a computer vision problem.

In the machine learning project, we would be detecting various important parameters that are needed to detect the wheat types. There are different values of the bounding boxes present in both the training and the testing set respectively.

## Directions to run the Ipython notebook 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository.  
3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location. 
4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link of the repository. 
5. The link of the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be a html link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone html" where the html is replaced by the link to this repository. 
6. Once downloaded, you might use the jupyter notebook to run the .ipynb files or other navigators to open this file.
